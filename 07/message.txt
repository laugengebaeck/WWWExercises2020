Hi, Stranger!
Please make sure to acknowledge each packet we sent to you instantly as we do not send you another one nor expecting any data from you before receiving your (additional) ACK-packet.
When I am awaiting a special action from you, I will mark my last packet with an IP-ID of 0xFFFF.
Please note: some Hypervisors like VirtualBox are modifying IP packets in NAT mode, so please use the bridged mode to test your script.
Take a look into the IP-ID of the first packet I sent you, it is your synack code.

You have to solve my little puzzles by sending special crafted packages in a TCP connection.
You already managed to solve the first "puzzle" by establishing a TCP connection.

Beware of the length of packets...
Like this oooooone
Make sure the connection does not crash because of these ordinary packets...

Let us play another game!
Send me a packet with your matriculation number as TCP payload (in UTF-8, like telnet). Make sure to set the TCP push flag, as I cannot guarantee to be awake when you send your packet.
This server does not support retransmission of packets, which is against the TCP specs.Therefore, your client must not use retransmissions.
Please acknowledge all packets before sending any payload.
Also make sure that each answer is packed into one packet as I will drop partial answers (although this is not the idea of TCP)
